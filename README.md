This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.
<br><br>

## Objective:
Simple application to use the basic features of Angular. This is a nuts store web app containing a home page, a product page, and a contact page. The product information comes from a JSON file. Here is the <a href="https://fretful-pot.surge.sh">URL</a> to my web application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
